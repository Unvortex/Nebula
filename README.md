This is a general-purpose editor for Wii games and stuff.
Below are the tools I have publicly released so far (my other ones are way too broken):

---
## **NSMBW Ingame Layout Editor** (Beta)
**Features**:
* Can move around Each Player's Lives, Coins, Star coins, score and timer
* Generates xmlyt file automatically

**Top Priority**:
* Box Select
* Undo/Redo
* Better Website Layout
* Grid Toggle

**In the Future**:
* Snapping
* Better Responsiveness
* Importing/Saving xmlyt files to tweak at a later time
* Individual Component Dragging (Like being able to move Star coin 1 and Star coin 2 separately, etc.)
* Opacity & Color Modification
* Conversion to brlyt

**Known Issues**:
* The box which triggers the elements to fade out when a player is nearby is in the same spot (This will be fixed)
* Refreshing completely resets all modifications (This will be replaced with a button in the future)

Let me know if there is anything else I should add through github's issues using the appropriate tag.

You guys can always take a look at the source and modify for yourselves, I would be happy to commit any improvements/optimizations made to the site.

I don't often document how my code works but if asked I will do my best to explain.
